    heart_te2: 'There is a significant individual difference in the resting heart rate of normal adults, with an average of around 75 beats per minute (between 60-100 beats per minute). Heart rate can vary depending on age, gender, and other physiological conditions. The heart rate of newborns is very fast, reaching over 130 beats per minute. In adults, women\'s heart rate is generally slightly faster than that of men. The same person\'s heart rate slows down during quiet or sleep, and increases during exercise or emotional arousal. Under the influence of certain drugs or neurohumoral factors, their heart rate may increase or decrease. People who frequently engage in physical labor and exercise have a slower heart rate.',
